# 💼 My Developer Portfolio

This is a **static portfolio website** I built using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**. I created it immediately after learning these technologies to get some real hands-on experience and start building a personal brand online.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project showcases:

- My basic understanding of HTML structure and semantic tags.
- Styling and responsive design using CSS and Bootstrap.
- A clean and mobile-friendly layout.
- Sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact.

It's a beginner-friendly portfolio that helped reinforce what I learned and served as my first step into frontend development.
